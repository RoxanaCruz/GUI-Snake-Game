                                                        Gui Snake Game
- Hellurr GitHubb, this is my final for the Intro to Computer Science class In my first year of college. I am very pleased to have learned Python as my first language as it is a very fun and versatile language (and easy), I had fun creating this game as It has many elements to it from the different stages and reactions from the snake as you consume more apples, to the sizing and display of the blocks and texts in the game. it took me approx three days to finish this from scratch, but that just goes to show how many details and operations you can implement with python.
